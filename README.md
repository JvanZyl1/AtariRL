So this is the repo made for learning to play Ms.Pacman with Pacman.    
It was wanted at one point to go all the way to play Alien, but due to time constraints it wasn't possible. 
That is why run_experiment doesn't work.

Ran on collab, manually choose file path to load the model.

Networks:
1. Q-Network
2. Dueling Q-Network
s
Transfer Learning:
1. Non Progressive
2. Proggresive Neural Networks

Agent options:
1. Q-Learning Type  : Deep & Double                     (x2)  
2. Buffer Type      : Replay & PER                      (x2)  
3. Exploration      : Epsilon-Greedy (& ICM)            (x2)
